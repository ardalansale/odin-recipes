    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart meat stock</li>
            <li>80 g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 sm,all yellow onion or shallots (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>300 g Italian Carnaroli or Arborio rice</li>
            <li>240 ml dry white wine, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspon saffron threads</li>
            <li>25 g grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground white ground pepper</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm the beef stock in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Soak the saffron threads or powder in 5 teaspoons of stock (hot &ndash;not boiling) for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan heat 50 g butter.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and stir thoroughly for about 3 minutes, in order to “coat” the rice well with the butter and onions.</li>
            <li>Add a soup ladle or two of the stock until the rice is just covered, and stir continuously with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>When the stock is almost completely absorbed by the rice, repeat this process as necessary for a total of 9 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the saffron to the risotto. Mix well and add one more a soup ladle of stock. Cook for 5-6 minutes until the stock is completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>When the rice is nearly tender to the bite, but with just a hint of resistance (al dente), 
                and the liquid you have added up to this point has been mostly absorbed (the risotto should still seem a bit “soupy”), add the Parmesan and butter to taste, about 30 g.</li>
            <li>Remove your risotto from the heat. At this point, keep stirring the risotto to blend in the cheese and butter. You can also add some salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. 
                Let it stand for 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Arrange the risotto on a serving dish or 4 singular plates, serve immediately. You can season with Parmesan and decorate with some saffron threads.</li>
        </ol>
